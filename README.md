## Motivation

Why create Tell?

1. [For the fun of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC-bjR6WeaM)

1. Because I've built a list over the past couple of years of

    * language features that I like, 
    
    * language features I dislike, and 
    
    * library features that I wish would be available at a language level. 
    
  It would be interesting to see if some of these ideas can be put together in a language.
  
1. There should probably be a third reason too. I can't think of something specific right now, but maybe something about learning stuff,
