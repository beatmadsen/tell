# The Tell programming language

## Motivation

### Why create Tell?

1. [For the fun of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC-bjR6WeaM)

1. Because I've built a list over the past couple of years of

    * language features that I like, 
    
    * language features I dislike, and 
    
    * library features that I wish would be available at a language level. 
    
  It would be interesting to see if some of these ideas can be put together in a language.
  
1. There should probably be a third reason too. I can't think of something specific right now, but maybe something about learning stuff.

### What does the name mean?

The name Tell primarily comes from the object oriented design principle of "Tell, don't ask". The language is designed so that, insofar as objects are concerned, you must do exactly that.

As a secondary inspiration, the Scala based actor library Akka uses the method 'tell', or its alias '!' to send data from one actor to another. Since all classes in Tell are actors, even if the syntax is different, 'telling' is a big part of using the language.
